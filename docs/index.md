# The BIDS Validator

The BIDS Validator is a web application, command-line utility,
and Javascript/Typescript library for assessing compliance with the
[Brain Imaging Data Structure][BIDS] standard.

## Getting Started

In most cases,
the simplest way to use the validator is to browse to the [BIDS Validator][] web page:

(Light theme)](_static/web_entrypoint_light.png){.only-light width="50%" align=center}

The web validator runs in-browser, and does not transfer data to any remote server.

In some contexts, such as when working on a remote server,
it may be easier to use the command-line.
The BIDS Validator can be run with the [Deno] runtime
(see [Deno - Installation][] for detailed installation instructions):

```shell
deno run -A jsr:@bids/validator
```
